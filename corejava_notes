	 ->programming languages
	 
	     pop
		 oop
		 mop
		 sop
		 ...
		 
	 
	 ->to make the software/application
	 
	 ->object oriented programming language
	 
	 ->using java what applications we can develop?
	 
	 
	 
	  we have two types of applciations
	  
	  
	    ->standalone applications/desktop applications -results are not sharable
		->distributed applications-results are sharable across the globe
		gmail.com
		facebook.com etc..
		
		
	 
	 jamesgosling -> in three editions
	 
	  jse->java standard edition --> standalone applications
	  jee->java enterprise edition -> distributed applications & standalone apps
	  jme->java micro/mobile edition -> 
	 
	 
if any requirement -> 

   program -> set of instructions

every programmer must follow some rules/syntaxes -> 

     
java -> sunmicrosystem 
     -> oracle 

	 
	 <datatype> <variablename>=<value>;
	 
	 

for java program, there is basic structure

 
  every java program must starts with by defining a class.
  
  
  without defining a class there is no java program .
  
  
  syntax:
     
	   class <classname>
	   {   
	      
	      public static void main(String[] args)
		  {
		    //logic
		  }
		  
	   }

note: java is case senstive programming language.

note: every java reserved keyword must be in lowercase.

note: without defining the main(), we can compile the program, but we can't run 
      the program because execution of java program should starts from main().
	  
	  

  i want to write the java program?
  
    prerequisites to write the java program?
	
	1.download the java software(jdk)->open source
	
	2.install this software
	
	3.select the editor(notepad,notepad++,eclipse,netbeans,intellij)
	
	4.write the java program 
	
    5.save the java program (<filename>.java)
	
	6.compile the java program (javac <filename>.java)
	
	7.run the java program (java <classname>)
	
	
why should we go for compiling the java program?

  java compiler will check for all the syntaxes
  
  java compiler -> compiletime error
  
  java compiler -> will generate .class file
  
  .java file contains source code
  .class file contains byte code
  
  byte code:
  
    byte code can not be understandable by human 
  
    byte code can be understandable by jvm(java interpretor)
	
	  jvm -> byte code and converts it into machine level code 
	  
	  
java compiler -> compiles the program (Checking the syntaxes)
java interpretor(jvm) -> executes the program (converting bytecode to machine level code)

 
in java, to display any information in the console one statement we have to use?

    System.out.println("welcome to java"); 
    

to compile 
   
    javac Welcome.java

to execute

     java <classname>
	 java Infosys
	 
	 
open the command prompt


in real world , we never use these basic editors to develop the programs

ide's ->integrated development environment


 eclipse
 myeclipse
 intellij
 netbeans
 bluej
 visualstudio
 ...
 
how to download and install the eclipse in your mahines?

note:
the code which we are writing in the ide is autocompiled


   jdk vs jre vs jvm
   
   
java development kit

   it provides two environments
   
         -dev environment(develop the java programs)
		 -runtime environment(execute the java programs)
		 
		 
jre:
   java runtime environment

      ->runtime environment (only we are able to execute the java applications)
	  
	  
jvm:
   java virtual machine

   
	 ->using this we can develop the actual java program
	 
	 
	 
'every java program should starts with by defining class 

  class <classname>
  {
   //variables

   //methods

  }   
	 
	 
variable:
``````````
variable is used to store the data

  it is a name which we are giving to memory location .

syntax:
  
   <datatypename> <variablename> = <value>;

  int x=100;  

  int 100=100;-invalid

  int int =100;//invalid

  int _xyz=100;

  int x123 =100;

  int 123x=100;

  int $xyz=123;

  int xyz*123=100;  
	 
	 
A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z digits 0-9, and two special characters such as _ underscore and $ dollar sign.

The first character must not be a digit.

Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names.

Java keywords cannot be used as variable names.

Variable names are case-sensitive.

There is no limit on the length of a variable name but by convention, it should be between 4 to 15 chars.

Variable names always should exist on the left-hand side of assignment operators.	 

example:
`````````


public class Welcome {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int x=100;
		//int int =100;
		int _xyz=123;
		
		int $xyz=123;
		byte b1 = 127;
		
		float f = 12.3467676f;
		double d = 56.6776565656556656;
		char c = 'a';//2 bytes
		boolean b =true;
		
		//int xyz abc = 123;
		//int xyz*123=12;
		//int 1xyz=123;
		
	}

}






Primitive Data Type: In Java, the primitive data types are the predefined data types of Java. They specify the size and type of any standard values. Java has 8 primitive data types namely byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean.


datatypes in java:

   4 types 
   
    integer 
	   byte
	   short
	   int
	   long
	   
	float 
	   float
	   double
	   
	charcter
	   char
	   
	boolean 
	   boolean (true/false)
	   
	
based on the value and the range will decide a specific datatype

every datatype is having 
 their own memory size and range 
 
  
  int x = 100;(4 bytes)
  
  
byte datatype -> 1 byte -> 8 bits


 -2^n-1 to 2^n-1 -1
 
 -2^7 to 2^7 -1
 
 -128 to 127
 
  byte b = 130;
  
 
usually float datatypes we are using to store decimal values
by default decimal data can be considerd as double type 

 
float f = 23.45f;
	 
	 
	 
method:
````````
method is the place where we are writing the logic to perform some operations 
based on the requirement.
